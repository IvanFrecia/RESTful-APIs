# RESTful-APIs
REST APIs with Flask and Python
NOTE: Tested using Postman Application (https://www.postman.com/downloads/)

Simple Flask app:
The code in this folder includes a simple Flask app and a HTML and JavaScript file which calls the Flask app endpoints.

API 1: 
Includes a Flask app which is an 'PI that represents items. It also includes user registration and authentication.

API 2: 
Extends 'API 1' by adding persistent storage of Items to a SQLite database.

API 3: 
Extends the code in 'API 2' by replacing the manual integration with SQLite, with SQLAlchemy—an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)—which allows us to easily replace SQLite with something like PostgreSQL or MySQL.

API 4:
Please read 'README.md' in 'API 4' folder as it is an inhereted and simplified version of 'API 3' to demonstrate how to apply flask-jwt-extended to this project.
